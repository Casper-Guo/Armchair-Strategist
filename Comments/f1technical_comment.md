Check out the interactive version of these graphics and more at my [strategy dashboard](https://armchair-strategist.dev/).

Aston Martin uses all allocated tyres during free practice, causing them to show up as used.

By far the most popular request is for the position plot to incorporate the starting grid. I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/FCBStar-of-the-South/comments/1jifcui/why_race_starting_positions_cannot_be_determined) to explain why this is not possible *at the moment*.

Please let me know if you have suggestions for improving these graphics or ideas for other graphics!
