We have made it to the final post of the season! A sincere thank you to everyone who have interacted with these posts and/or provided feedback. In a few moment I will also be doing an AMA and all around strategy discussion on this sub.

Check out the interactive version of these graphics and more at my [strategy dashboard](https://armchair-strategist.dev/).

All data sourced from [Fastf1](https://docs.fastf1.dev/).

Aston Martin uses all allocated tyres during free practice, causing them to show up as used.

Sometimes it is not possible to include the starting positions in plots. I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/FCBStar-of-the-South/comments/1jifcui/why_race_starting_positions_cannot_be_determined) explaining why.

Please let me know if you have suggestions for improving these graphics or ideas for other graphics!
