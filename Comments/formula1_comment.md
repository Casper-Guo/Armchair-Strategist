Check out the interactive version of these graphics and more at my [strategy dashboard](https://armchair-strategist.dev/).

Updates since last race:
- Strategy plot now gets a legend for fresh/used tyres
- Ensures lineplots are always properly annotated with driver annotations

Future Work:
- By far the most popular request is for the position plot to incorporate the starting grid. I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/FCBStar-of-the-South/comments/1jifcui/why_race_starting_positions_cannot_be_determined) to explain why this is not possible *at the moment*.

What other graphics do you want to see and how can these existing graphics be improved, question.
