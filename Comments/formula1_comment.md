Check out the interactive version of these graphics and more at my [strategy dashboard](https://armchair-strategist.dev/).

Aston Martin uses all allocated tyres during free practice, causing them to show up as used.

By far the most popular request is for the position plot to incorporate the starting grid. I wrote a [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/FCBStar-of-the-South/comments/1jifcui/why_race_starting_positions_cannot_be_determined) to explain why this is not possible *at the moment*.

What other graphics do you want to see and how can these existing graphics be improved, question.
